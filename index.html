    <h1>I School Pledge</h1>
    <p>
       <article>
         <section>
On my honor, I will try:
To serve people and society,
to create technology for important human needs,
and to abide by the I School pledge.
         </section>
         <section>
I am responsible for what I design and code.
I will do my best to be
inquisitive and not condescending,
ever-mindful of privacy and security,
         </section>
         <section>
to combat technological determinism,
to remember that artifacts have politics,
to beware the power of defaults.
I will use and abide by technical standards.
I will design with the tussle in mind.
and I will be accountable for the things I create in the world.
